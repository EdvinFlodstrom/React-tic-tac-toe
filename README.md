This is a mini project based on the following link from React: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

Because of the small size of the project, I will not be documenting a whole lot here.

I've started the project and set up the repository on GitHub. Also, I'm almost done with the project. Only now did I really run into anything worth documenting, and barely so. The finished tic-tac-toe game from the link above works really well and all, but it seemed to lack a message for a tie. When neither X nor O wins, it simply said 'Next player: O'. So, I added a few lines of code that checks if all the boxes have been checked, and if they have, a string 'Undecided' is returned. This code executes after the program has already decided that there is no winner, and it never happens if there are any boxes left. The 'Undecided' string makes for a message: 'Winner: Undecided' message upon game completion.

A bit later, I've now completed the project. I may or may not continue by adding extra functionality to this project. It depends on whether I start a new project or not.
